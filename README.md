# Crop Production Analysis in India

## Project Statement
The agricultural sector in India is marked by significant variability in crop production across different regions, states, and crop categories. This variability poses challenges in ensuring consistent crop yield and optimizing resource use. The problem at hand is to analyze crop production data to identify the most productive regions, zones, and crops, as well as to understand the factors influencing production levels. Additionally, there is a need to uncover correlations between production and other variables to enhance decision-making processes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and generating visualizations.
- **Power BI**: Used to create interactive dashboards and visual reports.

## Key Features
- Top 5 Producing States.
- Zone-Wise Production.
- Top 5 Producing Crops.
- Trend in Crop Production Over the Years.
